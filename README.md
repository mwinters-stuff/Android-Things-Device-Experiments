Android Things Device Experiments
=====================================

This is my play with Android Things and a couple of devices I have to make a Lego Train Points switch
with a servo.

This works well.


Pre-requisites
--------------

- Raspberry Pi 3
- Android Studio 2.2+
- PCA9685 PWM Board
- Adafruit RGB LCD (Negative backlight)
- Servo Motors
- Screen hooked up to HDMI and Mouse.

Build and install
=================

On Android Studio, click on the "Run" button.

Use
===
Look at the display, you get a range bar to select 0-180 degrees for left and right.
My lego points and servo seem to be good on 20 and 70 Degrees.
Select the channel
Click the buttons to test.

You can also use the buttons on the LCD board to select channels 0-4 with the
4 cursor buttons. The "Select" button will flip through different backlight
colours.
